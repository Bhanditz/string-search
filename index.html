    <h2>String Searching in Natural Language Content</h2>
      <p>Many Web implementations and applications have a different sort of
        string matching requirement from the one described above: the need for
        users to search documents for particular words or phrases of text. This
        section addresses the various considerations that an implementer might
        need to consider when implementing natural language text processing on
        the Web <em>other than</em> that mandated by a formal language or
        document format.</p>
      <p>There are several different kinds of string searching.</p>
      <p>When you are using a search engine, you are generally using a form of
        full text search. <dfn>Full text search</dfn> generally breaks natural
        language text into word segments and may apply complex processing to get
        at the semantic "root" values of words. For example, if the user
        searches for "run", you might want to find words like "running", "ran",
        or "runs" in addition to the actual search term "run". This process,
        naturally, is sensitive to language, context, and many other aspects of
        textual variation. It is also beyond the scope of this document.</p>
      <p>Another form of string searching, which we'll concern ourselves with
        here, is sub-string matching or "find" operations. This is the direct
        searching of the body or "corpus" of a document with the user's input.
        Find operations can have different options or implementation details,
        such as the addition or removal of case sensitivity, or whether the
        feature supports different aspects of a regular expression language or
        "wildcards".</p>
      <section id="searchingConsiderations">
        <h2>Considerations for Matching Natural Language Content</h2>
        <p class="issue">This section was identified as a new area needing
          document as part of the overall rearchitecting of the document. The
          text here is incomplete and needs further development. Contributions
          from the community are invited.</p>
        <p>The preceeding sections of this document were concerned with string 
		matching in formal languages, but there are other types of common text 
		matching operations on the Web. </p>
		  <p>Full natural language searching is a broad topic well beyond the 
		  aspirations of this document. However, implementers often need to 
		  provide simple "find text" algorithms and specification often try to 
		  define APIs to support these needs. Find operations on text generates different user expectations and thus has different
          requirements from the need for absolute identity matching needed by
          document formats and protocols. This section describes the 
		  requirements and considerations when designing a "find text" feature 
		  or protocol. It is important to note that domain-specific requirements 
		  may impose additional restrictions or alter the considerations 
		  presented here.</p>
        <p>One description of Unicode string searching can be found in Section 8
          (Searching and Matching) of [[UTS10]].</p>
        <p>One of the primary considerations for string searching is that, quite
          often, the user's input is not identical to the way that the text is
          encoded in the text being searched. This often happens because the 
		text can vary in ways the user cannot predict or because the user's 
		keyboard or input method does not provide ready access to the textual 
		variations needed. In these cases, users generally expect matching to
          be more "promiscuous", particularly when they don't add additional
          effort to their input. </p>
		  <p>For example, a user might expect a term entered in
          lowercase to match uppercase equivalents. Conversely, when the user
          expends more effort on the input—by using the shift key to produce
          uppercase or by entering a letter with diacritics instead of just the
          base letter—they might expect their search results to match (only) their
          more-specific input.</p>
		  <p>A different case is where the text can vary in multiple ways, but 
		  the user can only type a single search term in. For example, the 
		  Japanese language uses two different phonetic scripts, <em>hiragana</em> 
		  and <em>katakana</em>. These scripts encode the same phonemes; thus 
		  the user might expect that typing in a search term in <em>hiragana</em> 
		  would find the exact same word spelled out in <em>katakana</em>. A 
		  different example might be the presence or absence of short vowels in 
		  the Arabic and Hebrew scripts. For most languages in these scripts, 
		  the inclusion of the short vowels is entirely optional, but the 
		  presence of vowels in text being searched might impede a match if the 
		  user doesn't enter or know to enter them.</p>
        <p>This effect might vary depending on context as well. For example, a
          person using a physical keyboard may have direct access to accented
          letters, while a virtual or on-screen keyboard may require extra
          effort to access and select the same letters.</p>
        <p>Consider a document containing these strings: "re-resume",
          "RE-RESUME", "re-résumé", and "RE-RÉSUMÉ".</p>
        <p>In the table below, the user's input (on the left) might be
          considered a match for the above items as follows:</p>
        <table class="data">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">User Input</th>
              <th scope="col">Matched Strings</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>e (lowercase 'e')</td>
              <td>"re-resume", "RE-RESUME", "re-résumé", and "RE-RÉSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>E (uppercase 'E')</td>
              <td>"RE-RESUME" and "RE-RÉSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>é (lowercase 'e' with acute accent)</td>
              <td>"re-résumé" and "RE-RÉSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>É (uppercase 'E' with acute accent)</td>
              <td>"RE-RÉSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>In addition to variations of case or the use of accents, Unicode also
          has an array of canonical equivalents or compatibility characters (as
          described in the sections above) that might impact string searching.</p>
        <p>For example, consider the letter "K". Characters with a compatibility
          mapping to <code>U+004B LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K</code> include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Ķ U+0136</li>
          <li>Ǩ U+01E8</li>
          <li>ᴷ U+1D37</li>
          <li>Ḱ U+1E30</li>
          <li>Ḳ U+1E32</li>
          <li>Ḵ U+1E34</li>
          <li>K U+212A</li>
          <li>Ⓚ U+24C0</li>
          <li>㎅ U+3385</li>
          <li>㏍ U+33CD</li>
          <li>㏎ U+33CE</li>
          <li>Ｋ U+FF2B</li>
          <li>(a variety of mathematical symbols such as
            U+1D40A,U+1D43E,U+1D472,U+1D4A6,U+1D4DA)</li>
          <li>🄚  U+1F11A</li>
          <li>🄺 U+1F13A.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other differences include Unicode Normalization forms (or lack
          thereof). There are also ignorable characters (such as the variation
          selectors), whitespace differences, bidirectional controls, and other
          code points that can interfere with a match. </p>
        <p>Users might also expect certain kinds of equivalence to be applied to
          matching. For example, a Japanese user might expect that hiragana,
          katakana, and half-width compatibility katakana equivalents all match
          each other (regardless of which is used to perform the selection or
          encoded in the text). </p>
        <p>When searching text, the concept of "grapheme boundaries" and
          "user-perceived characters" can be important. See Section 3 of <cite>Character
            Model for the World Wide Web: Fundamentals</cite> [[!CHARMOD]] for a
          description. For example, if the user has entered a capital "A" into a
          search box, should the software find the character À (<span class="uname"

            translate="no">U+00C0 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACCENT GRAVE</span>)?
          What about the character "A" followed by U+0300 (a combining accent
          grave)? What about writing systems, such as Devanagari, which use
          combining marks to suppress or express certain vowels?</p>
