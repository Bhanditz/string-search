      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section id="goals">
        <h3>Goals and Scope</h3>
        <p>This document describes string searching—the process by which a 
		specification or implementation matches a natural language string 
		fragment against a specific document or series of documents. A common 
		example of string searching is the "find" command in a Web browser, but 
		there are many other forms of searching that a specification might wish 
		to define. </p>
        <p class="note">This document builds on <cite>Character Model for the 
		World Wide Web: Fundamentals</cite> [[!CHARMOD]] and <cite>Character 
		Model for the Word Wide Web: String Matching</cite> [[!CHARMOD-NORM]]. 
		Understanding the concepts in those documents are important to being 
		able to understand and apply this document successfully.</p>
        <p>The main target audience of this specification is W3C specification 
		developers who need to define some form of search or find algorithm: the 
		goal is to provide a stable reference to the concepts, terms, and 
		requirements needed.</p>
        <p>The concepts described in this document provide authors of 
		specifications, software developers, and content developers with a 
		common reference for consistent, interoperable text searching on the 
		World Wide Web. Working together, these three groups can build a 
		globally accessible Web.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="background">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>At the core of the character model is the Universal Character Set 
		(UCS), defined jointly by the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite>
          [[!Unicode]] and ISO/IEC 10646 [[!ISO10646]]. In this document, <dfn>
		Unicode</dfn>
          is used as a synonym for the Universal Character Set. A successful 
		character model allows Web documents authored in the world's writing 
		systems, scripts, and languages (and on different platforms) to be 
		exchanged, read, and searched by the Web's users around the world.</p>
        <p>The first few chapters of the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite>
          [[!Unicode]] provide useful background reading. In particular, the 
		<cite>Unicode Collation Algorithm</cite> [[!UTS10]] contains a chapter 
		on searching.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="terminology">
        <h3>Terminology and Notation</h3>
        <p>This section contains terminology and notation specific to this
          document.</p>
        <p>The Web is built on text-based formats and protocols. In order to
          describe string matching or searching effectively, it is necessary to
          establish terminology that allows us to talk about the different kinds
          of text within a given format or protocol, as the requirements and
          details vary significantly. </p>
        <p>Unicode code points are denoted as <code class="kw" translate="no">U+<em>hhhh</em></code>,
          where <code class="kw" translate="no"><em>hhhh</em></code> is a sequence of at
          least four, and at most six hexadecimal digits. For example, the
          character <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x20AC;</span> [<span class="uname">U+20AC EURO SIGN</span>]</span> has the code point <span class="uname" translate="no">U+20AC</span>.</p>
        <p>Some characters that are used in the various examples might not
          appear as intended unless you have the appropriate font. Care has been
          taken to ensure that the examples nevertheless remain understandable.</p>
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="legacy character encoding|legacy character encodings">legacy
            character encoding</dfn> is a character encoding not based on the
          Unicode character set.</p>
          
                   
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="transcoder|transcoders">transcoder</dfn> is a process that converts 
		text between two character encodings. Most commonly in this document it 
		refers to a process that converts from a <a>legacy character encoding</a> 
        to a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-charmod-20050215/#Unicode_Encoding_Form">Unicode encoding form</a>, 
		such as UTF-8.</p>
        <p><dfn id="def_syntactic_content">Syntactic content</dfn> is any text in a document format or protocol that belongs to the structure of the format or protocol. This definition includes values that are typically thought of as "markup" but can also include other values, such as the name of a field in an HTTP header. Syntactic content consists of all of the characters that form the <em>structure</em> of a format or protocol. For example, <span class="qchar">&lt;</span> and <span class="qchar">&gt;</span> (as well as the element name and various attributes they surround) are part of the syntactic content in an HTML document.</p>
        <p>Syntactic content usually is defined by a specification or specifications and
          includes both the defined, reserved keywords for the given protocol or
          format as well as string tokens and identifiers that are defined by
          document authors to form the structure of the document (rather than
        the "content" of the document).</p>
        <aside class="example">
          <p><cite>XML</cite> [[XML10]] defines specific elements, attributes,
            and values that are reserved across all XML documents. Thus, the
            word <code class="kw" translate="no">encoding</code> has a defined
            meaning inside the XML document declaration: it is a reserved name.
            XML also allows a user to define elements and attributes for a given
            document, for example, by using a DTD. In a document that uses a DTD that defines an
            element called <code class="kw">&lt;muffin&gt;</code>, <span class="qterm">muffin</span>
          is a part of the syntactic content.</p>
        </aside>
        <p><dfn>Natural language content</dfn> refers to the language-bearing
          content in a document and <b>not</b> to any of the surrounding or embedded 
          syntactic content that form part of the document structure. You can think
          of it as the actual "content" of the document or the "message" in a
          given protocol. Note that syntactic content can contain natural
          language content, such as when an [[HTML]] <code class="kw">img</code> element
          has an <code class="kw">alt</code> attribute containing a description of
          the image.</p>
          
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="resource|resources">resource</dfn>, in the context of this document,  is a given
          document, file, or protocol "message" which includes both the <a>natural
            language content</a> as well as the <a href="#def_syntactic_content" class="termref">syntactic content</a>
          such as identifiers surrounding or containing it. For example, in an
          HTML document that also has some CSS and a few <code class="kw" translate="no">script</code>
          tags with embedded JavaScript, the entire HTML document, considered as
          a file, is a resource. This term is intentionally similar to the term 
		'resource' as used in [[RFC3986]], although here the term is applied 
		loosely. </p>
          
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="user-supplied value|user-supplied values">user-supplied value</dfn> is unreserved syntactic 
        content in a <a>vocabulary</a> that is assigned by users, as distinct 
        from reserved keywords in a given format
        or protocol. For example, CSS class names are part of the syntax of a CSS
        style sheet. They are not reserved keywords, predefined by any CSS specification.
        They are subject to the syntactic rules of CSS. And they may (or may not)
        consist of natural language tokens.</p>
          
        <p>A <dfn id="def_vocabulary">vocabulary</dfn> provides the list of
          reserved names as well as the set of rules and specifications
          controlling how <a>user-supplied values</a> (such as identifiers) can be assigned in a
          format or protocol. This can include restrictions on range, order, or
          type of characters that can appear in different places. For example,
          HTML defines the names of its elements and attributes, as well as
          enumerated attribute values, which defines the "vocabulary" of HTML
          <a href="#def_syntactic_content" class="termref">syntactic content</a>. 
		Another example would be ECMAScript, which restricts the range of 
		characters that can appear at the start or in the body of an identifier 
		or variable name. It applies different rules for other cases, such as to 
		the values of string literals.</p>
		
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="grapheme|graphemes">grapheme</dfn> is a sequence of
          one or more characters in a visual representation of some text
          that a typical user would perceive as being a single unit (<q>character</q>).
          Graphemes are important for a number of text operations such as
          sorting or text selection, so it is necessary to be able to compute
          the boundaries between each user-perceived character. Unicode defines
          the default mechanism for computing graphemes in <cite>Unicode
            Standard Annex #29: Text Segmentation</cite> [[!UAX29]] and calls
          this approximation a <dfn>grapheme cluster</dfn>. There are two types
          of default grapheme cluster defined. Unless otherwise noted, grapheme
          cluster in this document refers to an extended default grapheme
          cluster. (A discussion of grapheme clusters is also given in Section 2
           of the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite>, [[!Unicode]]. Cf. near the end of
           <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/ch02.pdf">Section 2.11</a>
           in version 8.0 of The Unicode Standard)</p>
        <p>Because different natural languages have different needs, grapheme clusters
          can also sometimes require tailoring. For example, a Slovak user might
          wish to treat the default pair of grapheme clusters "ch" as a single
          grapheme cluster. Note that the interaction between the language of
          string content and the end-user's preferences might be complex.</p>
        <aside class="example">
			<p>The Hindi word for Unicode <q>&#x92f;&#x942;&#x928;&#x93f;&#x915;&#x94b;&#x921;</q> is composed of seven Unicode characters from the Devanagari script.
			</p>
          <p>Most users would identify this word as containing four units of text. Each of the first three graphemes consists of two characters: a syllable and a
            modifying vowel character. So the word contains seven Unicode characters, but only four graphemes:

          <li><a>Syntactic content</a> in this case includes all of the HTML markup. There are only two strings that are <strong>not</strong> part of the syntactic content: the word <em>"Shakespeare"</em> on line 4 and the sentence <em>"What&#x2019;s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."</em> on line 8. (The HTML entity <q><kbd>&amp;#x2019;</kbd></q> embedded in the sentence on line 8 <em>is</em> part of the syntactic content.)</li>
          <li><a>Natural language content</a> is shown in a <span class="shakespeare">bold blue font with a gray background</span>. In addition to the non-syntactic content, the <kbd>alt</kbd> value on line 7 (<em><q>William Shakespeare</q></em>) contains natural language text.</li>
          <li>User-supplied values are shown in <span class="userValue">italics</span>. In this case there are three user-supplied values on line 7: the values of the <kbd>src</kbd>, <kbd>alt</kbd>, and <kbd>id</kbd> attributes of the <kbd>img</kbd> tag. In addition, the value of the <kbd>lang</kbd> attribute on line 1 and the <kbd>charset</kbd> attribute on line 3 are user-supplied values.</li>
          <li><a>Vocabulary</a> is shown with <span class="vocabulary">red underlining</span>. The vocabulary of an HTML document are the elements and attributes (as well as some of the attribute values, such as the value <kbd>ltr</kbd> for the attribute <kbd>dir</kbd> in the example above) defined in [[HTML5]].</li>
          </ul>
          <p class=note>All of the text above (all text in a text file) makes up the resource. It's possible that a given resource will contain no natural language content at all (consider an HTML document consisting of four empty <code>div</code> elements styled to be orange rectangles). It's also possible that a resource will contain <em>no</em> syntactic content and consist solely of natural language content: for example, a plain text file with a soliloquy from <cite>Hamlet</cite> in it. Notice too that the HTML entity <code>&amp;#x2019;</code> appears in the natural language content and belongs to both the natural language content and the syntactic content in this resource.</p>

      <h2>String Searching in Natural Language Content</h2>
      <p>Many Web implementations and applications have a need for users or 
	  programs to search documents for particular words or phrases of natural 
	  language text. This is different from the sorts of programmatic matching 
	  needed by formal languages (such as markup languages such as [[HTML]]; 
	  style sheets [[CSS21]]; or data formats such as [[TURTLE]] or [[JSON-LD]]). </p>
      <p>There are many types of string searching. The form of string searching 
	  which we'll concern ourselves with here is sub-string matching or "find" 
	  operations. This is the direct searching of the body or "corpus" of a 
	  document with the user's input. Find operations can have different options 
	  or implementation details, such as the addition or removal of case 
	  sensitivity, or whether the feature supports different aspects of a 
	  regular expression language or "wildcards".</p>
      <p>A different type of string searching, <strong>which is outside the 
	  scope of this document</strong>, is <dfn>Full Text Search</dfn>. When you 
	  are using a search engine, you are generally using a form of full text 
	  search. Full text search generally breaks natural language text into word 
	  segments and may apply complex processing to get at the semantic "root" 
	  values of words. For example, if the user searches for "run", you might 
	  want to find words like "running", "ran", or "runs" in addition to the 
	  actual search term "run". This process, naturally, is sensitive to 
	  language, context, and many other aspects of textual variation. </p>
	  
	  <section id="otherEquivalences">
         <h3>Other Types of Equivalence</h3>
         
         <p>In addition to the forms of character equivalence described in [[!CHARMOD-NORM]], there are other types of equivalence that are interesting when performing string searching. The forms of equivalence found in the String Matching document are all based on character properties assigned by Unicode or due to the mapping of  legacy character encodings to the Unicode character set. The "interesting equivalences" in this section that are outside of those defined by Unicode.</p>

		 
		 <p>For example, Japanese uses two syllabic scripts,
		 <code>hiragana</code> and <code>katakana</code>. A 
		 user searching a document might type in text in one script, but wish to find 
		 equivalent text in both scripts. These additional "text 
		 normalizations" are sometimes application, natural language, or domain 
		 specific and shouldn't be overlooked by specifications or 
		 implementations as an additional consideration.</p>
		 <p>Another similar example is called <dfn>digit shaping</dfn>. Some scripts,
		 such as Arabic or Thai, have their own digit characters for the numbers from 0 to 9.
		 In some Web applications, the familiar ASCII digits are replaced for display
		 purposes with the local digit shapes. In other cases, the text actually might
		 contain the Unicode characters for the local digits. Users attempting to search
		 a document might expect that typing one form of digit will find the eqivalent
		 digits.</p>
		 <aside class="example" title="Examples of digit shapes in four scripts">
		 <p>Here are some selected examples of different digit shapes, from zero to nine, in four scripts. Many scripts have equivalent sets of digits with distinct shapes.</p>

        <h2>Considerations for Searching</h2>
        <p class="issue">This section was identified as a new area needing 
		document as part of the overall rearchitecting of the document. The text 
		here is incomplete and needs further development. Contributions from the 
		community are invited.</p>
		  <p>Implementers often need to provide simple "find text" algorithms 
		  and specifications often try to define APIs to support these needs. 
		  Find operations on text generate different user expectations and thus 
		  have different requirements from the need for absolute identity 
		  matching needed by document formats and protocols. It is important to 
		  note that domain-specific requirements may impose additional 
		  restrictions or alter the considerations presented here.</p>
		  <section id="UserInput">
		  <h3>Variations in User Input</h3>
        <p>One of the primary considerations for string searching is that, quite 
		often, the user's input is not identical to the way that the text being 
		searched is 
		encoded. </p>
			  <p>One primary reason this happens is because the text 
		can vary in ways the user cannot predict. In other cases it is because the user's keyboard 
		or input method does not provide ready access to the textual variations 
		needed&mdash;or because the user cannot be bothered to input the text accurately. For example,
		users often omit accents when entering Latin-script languages, particularly on mobile keyboards, even though the text they
		are searching includes the accents. In these cases, users generally expect the search operation to be more 
		"promiscuous" to make up for the failure to add additional effort to 
		their input. </p>
		  <p>For example, a user might expect a term entered in lowercase to 
		  match uppercase equivalents. Conversely, when the user expends more 
		  effort on the input&mdash;by using the shift key to produce uppercase or 
		  by entering a letter with diacritics instead of just the base 
		  letter&mdash;they might expect their search results to match (only) their 
		  more-specific input.</p>
		  <p>A different case is where the text can vary in multiple ways, but 
		  the user can only type a single search term in. For example, the 
		  Japanese language uses two different phonetic scripts, <em>hiragana</em> 
		  and <em>katakana</em>. These scripts encode the same phonemes; thus 
		  the user might expect that typing in a search term in <em>hiragana</em> 
		  would find the exact same word spelled out in <em>katakana</em>. </p>
			  <p>A 
		  different example might be the presence or absence of short vowels in 
		  the Arabic and Hebrew scripts. For most languages in these scripts, 
		  the inclusion of the short vowels is entirely optional, but the 
		  presence of vowels in text being searched might impede a match if the 
		  user doesn't enter or know to enter them.</p>
        <p>This effect might vary depending on context as well. For example, a 
		person using a physical keyboard may have direct access to accented 
		letters, while a virtual or on-screen keyboard may require extra effort 
		to access and select the same letters.</p>
        <p>Consider a document containing these strings: "re-resume", 
		"RE-RESUME", "re-r&#xe9;sum&#xe9;", and "RE-R&#xc9;SUM&#xc9;".</p>
        <p>In the table below, the user's input (on the left) might be 
		considered a match for the above items as follows:</p>
        <table class="data">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">User Input</th>
              <th scope="col">Matched Strings</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>e (lowercase 'e')</td>
              <td>"re-resume", "RE-RESUME", "re-r&#xe9;sum&#xe9;", and "RE-R&#xC9;SUM&#xc9;"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>E (uppercase 'E')</td>
              <td>"RE-RESUME" and "RE-R&#xc9;SUM&#xc9;"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>&#xe9; (lowercase 'e' with acute accent)</td>
              <td>"re-r&#xe9;sum&#xe9;" and "RE-R&#xc9;SUM&#xc9;"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>&#xc9; (uppercase 'E' with acute accent)</td>
              <td>"RE-R&#xc9;SUM&#xc9;"</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>In addition to variations of case or the use of accents, Unicode also 
		has an array of canonical equivalents or compatibility characters (as 
		described in the sections above) that might impact string searching.</p>
        <p>For example, consider the letter "K". Characters with a compatibility 
		mapping to <code>U+004B LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K</code> include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>&#x136; U+0136</li>
          <li>&#x1e8; U+01E8</li>
          <li>&#x1d37; U+1D37</li>
          <li>&#x1e30; U+1E30</li>
          <li>&#x1e32; U+1E32</li>
          <li>&#x1e34; U+1E34</li>
          <li>&#x212a; U+212A</li>
          <li>&#x24c0; U+24C0</li>
          <li>&#x3385; U+3385</li>
          <li>&#x33cd; U+33CD</li>
          <li>&#x33ce; U+33CE</li>
          <li>&#xff2b; U+FF2B</li>
          <li>(a variety of mathematical symbols such as 
		  U+1D40A,U+1D43E,U+1D472,U+1D4A6,U+1D4DA)</li>
          <li>&#x1f11a; U+1F11A</li>
          <li>&#x1f13a; U+1F13A.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other differences include Unicode Normalization forms (or lack 
		thereof). There are also ignorable characters (such as the variation 
		selectors), whitespace differences, bidirectional controls, and other 
		code points that can interfere with a match. </p>
        <p>Users might also expect certain kinds of equivalence to be applied to 
		matching. For example, a Japanese user might expect that hiragana, 
		katakana, and half-width compatibility katakana equivalents all match 
		each other (regardless of which is used to perform the selection or 
		encoded in the text). </p>
        <p>When searching text, the concept of "grapheme boundaries" and 
		"user-perceived characters" can be important. See Section 3 of <cite>
		Character Model for the World Wide Web: Fundamentals</cite> [[!CHARMOD]] 
		for a description. For example, if the user has entered a capital "A" 
		into a search box, should the software find the character &#xc0; 
		(<span class="uname" translate="no">U+00C0 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACCENT GRAVE</span>)? 
		What about the character "A" followed by U+0300 (a combining accent 
		grave)? What about writing systems, such as Devanagari, which use 
		combining marks to suppress or express certain vowels?</p>
